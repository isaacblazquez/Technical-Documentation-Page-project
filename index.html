              <p>If you've never used an object-oriented programming language before, you'll need to learn a few basic concepts before you can begin writing any code. This lesson will introduce you to objects, classes, inheritance, interfaces, and packages. Each discussion focuses on how these concepts relate to the real world, while simultaneously providing an introduction to the syntax of the Java programming language.</p>

                <h3>What Is an Object?</h3>
              </header>
               <p>Objects are key to understanding object-oriented technology. Look around right now and you'll find many examples of real-world objects: your dog, your desk, your television set, your bicycle.</p>
              <p>Real-world objects share two characteristics: They all have state and behavior. Dogs have state (name, color, breed, hungry) and behavior (barking, fetching, wagging tail). Bicycles also have state (current gear, current pedal cadence, current speed) and behavior (changing gear, changing pedal cadence, applying brakes). Identifying the state and behavior for real-world objects is a great way to begin thinking in terms of object-oriented programming.</p>
               <p>Bundling code into individual software objects provides a number of benefits, including:<p>
            <ul>
                <li>Modularity: The source code for an object can be written and maintained independently of the source code for other objects. Once created, an object can be easily passed around inside the system.</li>
                <li>Information-hiding: By interacting only with an object's methods, the details of its internal implementation remain hidden from the outside world.</li>
                Code re-use: If an object already exists (perhaps written by another software developer), you can use that object in your program. This allows specialists to implement/test/debug complex, task-specific objects, which you can then trust to run in your own code.</li>
                <li>Pluggability and debugging ease: If a particular object turns out to be problematic, you can simply remove it from your application and plug in a different object as its replacement. This is analogous to fixing mechanical problems in the real world. If a bolt breaks, you replace it, not the entire machine.</li>
               </ul>

               <h3> What Is a Class?</h3>
              </header>
              <p>In the real world, you'll often find many individual objects all of the same kind. There may be thousands of other bicycles in existence, all of the same make and model. Each bicycle was built from the same set of blueprints and therefore contains the same components. In object-oriented terms, we say that your bicycle is an instance of the class of objects known as bicycles. A class is the blueprint from which individual objects are created.</p>

<p>The following <strong>Bicycle</strong> class is one possible implementation of a bicycle:</p>
              <code>
                class Bicycle {</br>
    int cadence = 0;</br>
    int speed = 0;</br>
    int gear = 1;</br>
</br>
    void changeCadence(int newValue) {</br>
         cadence = newValue;</br>
    }</br>
</br>
    void changeGear(int newValue) {</br>
         gear = newValue;</br>
    }</br>
</br>
    void speedUp(int increment) {</br>
         speed = speed + increment;   </br>
    }</br>
</br>
    void applyBrakes(int decrement) {</br>
         speed = speed - decrement;</br>
    }</br>
</br>
    void printStates() {</br>
         System.out.println("cadence:" +</br>
             cadence + " speed:" + </br>
             speed + " gear:" + gear);</br>
    }</br>
}</br>
               </code>
            </section>
             <section class="main-section" id="What_Is_Inheritance?">
              <header>
                <h3>What Is Inheritance?</h3>
              </header>
              <p>Different kinds of objects often have a certain amount in common with each other. Mountain bikes, road bikes, and tandem bikes, for example, all share the characteristics of bicycles (current speed, current pedal cadence, current gear). Yet each also defines additional features that make them different: tandem bicycles have two seats and two sets of handlebars; road bikes have drop handlebars; some mountain bikes have an additional chain ring, giving them a lower gear ratio.</p>
              <p>Object-oriented programming allows classes to inherit commonly used state and behavior from other classes. In this example, Bicycle now becomes the <i>superclass</i> of <code>MountainBike</code>, <code>RoadBike</code>, and <code>TandemBike</code>. In the Java programming language, each class is allowed to have one direct superclass, and each superclass has the potential for an unlimited number of subclasses:</p>
              <code>
                class MountainBike extends Bicycle {</br>
</br>
    // new fields and methods defining </br>
    // a mountain bike would go here</br>
</br>
}</br>
               </code>
              <ul>
                  <li></li>
              </ul>
            </section>
             <section class="main-section" id="What_Is_an_Interface?">
              <header>
                <h3>What Is an Interface?</h3>
              </header>
              <p>As you've already learned, objects define their interaction with the outside world through the methods that they expose. Methods form the object's interface with the outside world; the buttons on the front of your television set, for example, are the interface between you and the electrical wiring on the other side of its plastic casing. You press the "power" button to turn the television on and off.</p>
<p>
In its most common form, an interface is a group of related methods with empty bodies. A bicycle's behavior, if specified as an interface, might appear as follows:</p>
              <p></p>
              <code>
                interface Bicycle {</br>
</br>
                //  wheel revolutions per minute</br>
                void changeCadence(int newValue);</br>
</br>
                void changeGear(int newValue);</br>
</br>
                void speedUp(int increment);</br>
</br>
                void applyBrakes(int decrement);</br>
            }</br>
                
                
               </code>

<p>To implement this interface, the name of your class would change (to a particular brand of bicycle, for example, such as ACMEBicycle), and you'd use the implements keyword in the class declaration:</p>
<code>
  class ACMEBicycle implements Bicycle {</code>
              <ul>Notes:
                  <li>To actually compile the ACMEBicycle class, you'll need to add the public keyword to the beginning of the implemented interface methods. You'll learn the reasons for this later in the lessons on Classes and Objects and Interfaces and Inheritance.</li>
              </ul>
